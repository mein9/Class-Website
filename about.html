      <p class="wordSalad">
        Retired Army Electromagnetic Spectrum Manager, with an active Secret
        clearance. Currently, I am enrolled in the Washington Vets to Tech
        (WaV2T) program, specializing in Cloud Application Development, with an
        expected completion date in August 2024. This intensive program grants
        18 college credits toward a bachelor's degree in computer science. My
        studies encompass programming languages such as Java, JavaScript,
        Python, HTML5 and technologies like Linux and SQL. Actively seeking
        career opportunities in the domains of Cloud/Application Development or
        IT Support roles. Bringing a solution-focused mindset, exceptional
        leadership acumen, and a collaborative approach to teamwork, I have
        honed these skills during my service in the military. I am eager to find
        a company that fosters continuous growth where I can proudly contribute
        and learn over the long term while providing excellent customer service.
